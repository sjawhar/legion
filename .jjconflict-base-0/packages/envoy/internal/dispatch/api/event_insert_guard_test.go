// TestOnlyTheBrokerInsertsEvents enforces what every reader of the event log by id rests on: every
// row of it is written by events.Broker.Append, which keeps two invariants no other insert would.
//
// The writer invariant: Append's transaction holds its transaction id before the insert draws the
// row's id from events_id_seq (lockEventOwner takes it with pg_current_xact_id). The safe horizon's
// proof needs it (events/horizon.go): a transaction that drew an id at or below one an observer saw
// committed holds a transaction id below the observer's own, so once no transaction id below the
// observer's is running, that id is final. A bare insert, in a transaction that has written
// nothing before it, takes its transaction id only as it writes the row, after its default drew the
// id, so an observation taken between the two could prove a horizon above an id still open. The
// relay (event_stream_relay.go), the delivery hub and `GET /references?since=` would then read past
// that id, and its row, committed later, would reach no open subscription until the page subscribed
// again -- a missing comment or ask on an open page, with nothing to show for it in any log.
//
// Owner sequence allocation: Append locks the event's owner row and takes the owner's next seq under
// that lock, so one owner's events commit in id order and their seqs run without a gap or a repeat.
// An insert elsewhere could write a seq out of that order, and the Legion daemon, which fences an
// issue's facts on their seq, would drop as stale an event whose seq it had already passed.
//
// Its reach is the statement as the module scan can assemble it (TestNoForUpdateOnOwnerTables):
// string literals and chains of literals and package-level constants, in every non-test Go file
// of the module. A test inserts events directly on purpose -- a backlog to page through, a row
// shape to serve -- so test sources are outside it, as they are outside that scan.
