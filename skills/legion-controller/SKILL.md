# Legion Controller

The controller is the one persistent, wake-driven session for a Legion project. It keeps the
project's admission slots full with the highest-priority work, and makes triage, escalation, and
human-interaction judgments; it never does phase-worker work or routes raw events into an
architect.

## Start and claim the controller role

The Legion extension claims `legion-<project>-controller` and registers controller readiness
with the daemon during session startup. Do not handle a wake unless that startup succeeded.

The daemon runs the controller as an interactive OMP terminal session in its private tmux
server (the pane runs plain `omp`, not `--mode rpc`, and no `legion worker-shim`; Sami reaches
it with `tmux -L legion-<project> select-window -t <window id> \; attach -t legion-<project>`,
the window id being `controllerLocator.tmuxWindowId` in `legion state --json` — every window
opens detached, so a bare `attach` lands on whichever window is current). Sami may attach and
type into this session at any time. The pane carries no GitHub credential: its GitHub token
variables are emptied, and both `legion gh -- <args>` and `legion threads resolve` are refused.
The controller reads Dispatch and applies its controller capability with `legion status <KEY>
<status>`; it never reads GitHub or merges a pull request.

For an interactive takeover from a hand-started OMP session, start OMP with
`LEGION_CONTROLLER_SECRET` (or `LEGION_CONTROLLER_SECRET_FILE`, a path to a file holding it),
`LEGION_DAEMON_URL`, `LEGION_STATE_DIR` (the daemon's state directory), and `LEGION_GRANT_FILE`
(an absolute path to a file only you can read, under a 0700 directory; the extension writes
each command's grant there and every `bash` call is blocked without it) in its environment. Do
not set `LEGION_CONTROLLER=1` — that marker is the daemon pane's own, and a session carrying it
claims at startup and reports its transcript as the pane's. Then run:

```text
/legion-claim-controller
```

The command resolves the project from daemon state, claims the Envoy role for the current
session, and posts readiness before controller commands can act. From then on this session's
shell commands are wrapped with a controller grant, but the grant holds no GitHub credential;
`legion status <KEY> <status>` works through the controller secret in this session's environment
(`LEGION_CONTROLLER_SECRET` or its `_FILE`), not the grant — if it fails, that is the variable to check.
The takeover moves the role
and the daemon's recorded session id to this session; it never replaces the transcript the
daemon recorded for its own pane, so a later respawn of that pane resumes the pane's own
conversation, not yours. Never pass a secret as a command argument or copy it into a transcript.
The claim is kept alive automatically afterwards: the Envoy registration heartbeat re-asserts it
and re-posts readiness whenever the listener loses sight of this session, so
`/legion-claim-controller` is the manual override, not a routine step after a listener restart.

Two limits of a takeover session. It caches the controller secret it started with: after the
daemon respawns its own pane the secret rotates, every `bash` call in the takeover session then
fails with a 403 from the grant mint, and the fix is to start a fresh OMP with the new secret,
not to retry. And the role does not follow `/new` or `/fork` in a takeover session — without
`LEGION_CONTROLLER=1` the new session is not a Legion session to the extension — so after either
command run `/legion-claim-controller` again.

This handshake lets the daemon redeliver held controller work. It does not turn the controller
into a state holder: daemon state and the Dispatch project remain authoritative.

### Started by the operator

When the daemon cannot open a terminal for you — the Go daemon, under either runtime, since it
launches no controller — nobody launched your
pane: the operator ran `legion controller start --config controller.yaml [--daemon-url <url>]` on
their own machine, and you are that foreground OMP session. The command fetched a fresh controller
secret from the daemon with the operator's token, wrote it to a 0600 file under `LEGION_STATE_DIR`
(`~/.local/state/legion/<project>-controller` by default) beside the `gh` shim and the `legion`
launcher, and started you with `LEGION_CONTROLLER=1` and the same environment a tmux controller pane
carries, so nothing changes in how you handle wakes. Under the TypeScript daemon the extension
claims the role and calls `/controller/ready` exactly as under tmux; under the Go daemon
(`LEGION_DAEMON_API=go` in your environment) it registers on `/legion/v1/claims/register` with the
secret, claims the role, then subscribes to `notifications.legion.<project>.controller`, where the
Go daemon publishes the rows marked from the Go daemon in the wake routing table. The daemon records
you as `controllerLocator: {runtime, external: true, sessionId, registeredAt}`, `runtime` being the
daemon's own (`kubernetes`, or `tmux` under the Go daemon). The TypeScript daemon reads your
liveness from the Envoy role registry (the holder of
`legion-<project>-controller` and its `last_seen`), not from a pane: keep the session running.
Exiting it leaves the project without a controller until the operator runs the command again —
the TypeScript daemon logs `controller not registered; run legion controller start` once per
boot-timeout interval and launches nothing itself. `legion state` and `legion status <KEY>
<status>` work here over `LEGION_DAEMON_URL`. A second `legion controller start` replaces you: it
mints a new secret, so your grants stop working and the role moves to the new session.

### What happened before you started (Go daemon)

The Go daemon's controller topic is a wake for a session that is running when it is published.
Envoy hands an Oh My Pi session no retained copy of a notice published before it subscribed, so a
hold, a tree architect's failed claim, a new triage root, or a freed slot from while no controller
ran never arrives as a wake. At every start, before anything else:

1. Read `legion state --json` and handle each issue whose `issues.<KEY>.phase` is `held` (its
   `issues.<KEY>.holdReason` is `escalated` when its architect sent it to you, and absent while the
   architect is still deciding or while its tree lingers or is closed, where the hold waits for the
   tree's re-admission and needs nothing from you), and each tree root whose
   `issues.<KEY>.architect.state` is `failed` and whose `issues.<KEY>.phase` is not `done`, exactly
   as the matching wake below. A parked tree (root phase `done`: it lingers or is closed) needs
   nothing from you: a failed architect ignores the park and reads `failed` until the tree closes.
2. List the project's triage issues handed to Legion with
   `dispatch_issues({project, status: "triage", label: "legion", limit: 250, offset: 0})`.
   When its first line ends `(showing 1-250 of N)`, read the next page with `offset: 250`, and so
   on until you have all N rows. The rows show no parent, so open each row with `dispatch_read`:
   one whose `Links:` name a `child_of` issue is a child, which its parent's architect owns, so
   leave it, whether or not `legion state --json` records it (a `child_of` under `Referenced by:`
   is a child of this issue, not its parent). Of the rest, triage each that `legion state --json`
   does not record under `issues` as a new issue. A root recorded there and now in `triage` is work
   the daemon holds that a human pulled back: never re-admit it yourself; name it in your summary to
   the human ("<KEY> was pulled back to triage; what do you want?").
3. Fill the free admission slots ([Keeping the slots full](#keeping-the-slots-full-go-daemon)).
4. Post the day's report when it is due ([Daily report](#daily-report-go-daemon)).

The issue record and Dispatch are the truth; the topic is the wake.

### Issues handed to Legion (Go daemon)

The Go daemon works only the issues handed to it with the Dispatch label `legion` (in any case),
since its project may be shared with humans and other agents. It never admits a root in `todo`
without the label, and wakes you for a root in `triage` only while the root carries it and is
unrecorded: on its creation with the label, and on each change to it after that while it stays
in triage, the change that adds the label included (the dashboard creates an issue without
labels, so a human adds it from the issue header). Two parties hand work over: a person, who sets
the label from the issue header, and you, when you fill a free slot (below). A person's label is
their decision: never take it off. A child needs no label: it runs under its tree's architect
once its root is admitted. `legion status <KEY> todo` admits a root only while it carries the
label, so a root you hand over or file for Legion to run carries it first (`labels` in
`dispatch_issue_update` or `dispatch_issue`). Taking the label off a waiting root drops it from
the waiting line; taking it off an admitted tree does not stop it.

## Keeping the slots full (Go daemon)

Picking the next work is your job: nobody hand-feeds issues to Legion. Keep every admission slot
filled with the highest-priority root issue Legion can take.

**When.** At every start (step 3 above), and on each `slot-free on <KEY>` wake: the daemon
released `<KEY>`'s slot, because its tree finished or left the workflow, and no waiting root took
it.

**Scope first.** The scope the deployment instructions state decides which issues are candidates
at all, before anything below. When they say you hand Legion no issue yourself, or that Legion
runs only issues someone else sets to `todo`, the walk takes nothing: stop here, whatever slots
are free. When they narrow the scope (a repository, a kind of change, paths never to touch), a
candidate outside it is skipped (the last row of the table below).

**How many.** Read `legion state --json`. The free slots are `admission.cap` minus the roots in
`admission.active` and in `admission.waiting` (a waiting root takes the next slot before anything
you add). With none free, stop.

**Candidates.** The project's open issues in `todo`, `backlog`, or `triage`, taken one priority at
a time: `priority: [0]` first, then `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, and `[null]` (no priority) last. Within
one priority, list `todo`, then `backlog`, then `triage`, since `todo` is what a person already
called ready; within one status, keep the listing's order, which is the board's rank:

```text
dispatch_issues({ project: "<PROJECT>", status: "todo", priority: [0], limit: 250, offset: 0 })
```

When the first line ends `(showing 1-250 of N)`, the next page is `offset: 250`, then `500`. Read
pages only as far as you need: stop listing once the free slots are filled. `<PROJECT>` is the
Dispatch project key, the prefix of this deployment's issue keys (`AGENTC-12` → `AGENTC`), which is
also `daemon.project` in `legion state --json`: the project key exactly as `legion.yaml` writes it.
A row that shows `claimed by …` and does not end its claim with `· not running` (the route, when
the row shows one, comes after the claim) is claimed, as the table below says: skip it without
reading it.

**Walk.** Take the remaining rows in that order until the free slots are filled. Read each one with
`dispatch_read({ issue: "<KEY>" })` and skip it when any of these holds:

| Skip when | How you check it |
|---|---|
| It is not a root | `Links:` names a `child_of` issue. Its parent's architect owns it. A `child_of` under `Referenced by:` is a child of this issue, not its parent. |
| Legion ran it before | `legion state --json` records it under `issues`, whatever its status, or `Events:` show a status write by `session legion-daemon:<PROJECT>`. That actor is the daemon's on every `legion status` (yours included) and on its own `in_progress` at admission, so it also finds a tree an earlier daemon store ran and parked. Name each one you skip for this in your summary. The walk never sends a root Legion already ran back into Legion; only a person does, with the label and `todo`, which the daemon admits on its own. |
| A running session or a person claims it | `Claimed by:` names anyone and does not end `· not running`. `· liveness unknown` counts as claimed: the agent registry could not be read, so nothing says the holder stopped. A claim ending `· not running` has lapsed, and the issue is free. |
| Its route reaches a running session | `Route:` names a route with nothing after it, or with `(held by …)`. `(nobody holds it right now)` and `(that session is not running right now)` reach nobody; `(the Envoy listener did not answer, …)` counts as reaching someone. `Route: none` is free. |
| A pull request is linked or named | `External links:` lists a pull request (kind `github_pr`, or a URL ending `/pull/<n>`), or a comment or message among `Events:` names one. You cannot read GitHub, so an open, merged, or closed pull request all count. A person who wants Legion on it anyway hands it over themselves: the label, then `todo`. |
| Its assignee is working it | `Assignee:` names a person who holds the claim (the row above), or whose own comment or message among `Events:` says they are working on it. The assignee alone is who answers the issue's questions, not who works it. |
| A person parked it with a reason | It is in `backlog`, the `Events:` line that moved it there (`issue.updated · … · status backlog`) is a person's (`user <login>`), and a comment or message says why. A move by `session legion-daemon:<PROJECT>` is Legion's own, which the row above already skips. When the events the read shows do not reach back to that move, you cannot tell who parked it: skip it. |
| It is outside this deployment's scope | Read the scope the deployment instructions state against the title and, when the title does not settle it, the spec (`dispatch_doc_read({ issue: "<KEY>" })`). When in doubt, skip it. |

**Take.** For each candidate that passes, in order:

1. Add the label and keep the labels it has, which `Labels:` lists (`none` is no labels). `labels`
   replaces the whole set, so a label you leave out is removed. An issue already labelled `legion`
   skips this step.

   ```text
   dispatch_issue_update({ issue: "<KEY>", labels: ["<each current label>", "legion"] })
   ```

2. Admit it with `legion status <KEY> todo`. One already in `todo` needs no status write: the
   label admits it. Labelling a `triage` root wakes you with its own `triage on <KEY>`; by the time
   you read it the root is recorded, and that wake needs nothing.
3. Post one short comment that says Legion took it and who is asked at its design gate, from the
   `Assignee:` line:

   ```text
   dispatch_comment({ issue: "<KEY>", body: "Legion took this issue: it was the highest-priority open issue nobody else was working on. Assigned to <login>, who approves its design and answers its questions." })
   ```

   When the line says `unassigned`, end the body with `Unassigned: nobody's Inbox shows its design
   approval or its questions until someone takes it from the issue header (Assignee, beside
   Priority).` instead.

The daemon admits each root when Dispatch's event reaches it; the next `legion state --json`
shows it in `admission.active`. When the candidates run out with slots still free, leave those
slots free and say so in your summary.

## Daily report (Go daemon)

Once a day, post one Dispatch message that says what Legion finished, what it closed without a
change and why, and what is running.

**Where.** On the issue the deployment instructions name for Legion's reports. With none named,
on the project's `Legion daily report` issue:
`dispatch_search({ query: "\"Legion daily report\"", project: "<PROJECT>" })` finds it. When it
does not exist, create it once and park it in `icebox`, so nobody takes it as work; it never
carries the `legion` label:

```text
dispatch_issue({ project: "<PROJECT>", title: "Legion daily report", spec: "## Summary\n\nLegion's controller posts one message here each day: what Legion finished, what it closed without a change and why, and what is running. This issue is not work, so it carries no `legion` label and stays in icebox." })
legion status <report KEY> icebox
```

**When.** At every start and on the first wake of each UTC day: read the report issue with
`dispatch_read`, and post when its `Events:` show no `message.created` from today. You have no
clock of your own, so the report rides the day's first wake; the next one covers a day that had
none.

**What.** One `dispatch_message({ issue: "<report KEY>", body })` of at most 2,000 characters,
written as `skill://dispatch`'s "Writing for the human" says: every issue by its key and title,
every pull request by its URL.

- **Finished.** `dispatch_issues({ project: "<PROJECT>", status: "done", updated_since: "<the
  previous report's time, or 24 hours ago>", limit: 250 })`, read every page, and keep the issues
  `legion state --json` records under `issues` whose `issue.closed` event is after the previous
  report. For each, `dispatch_read` it: the pull request under `External links:` is the one that
  merged.
- **Closed without a change.** Those with no pull request, each with the reason its closing
  message gave (the `message.created` just before `issue.closed` among `Events:`).
- **Running.** Each root in `admission.active` with its `issues.<KEY>.phase`, and the roots in
  `admission.waiting`.

A day with nothing finished says so in one sentence. When the lists do not fit, keep the counts
and the highest-priority issues.

## Deployment instructions

Deployment instructions, when present, are the operator's standing rules for this repository —
required checks, deploy/smoke commands, code-owner expectations, and standing roles you may
consult. They override this skill's defaults where they conflict; they never override a Sami ruling
quoted here.

## Turn discipline

- **Direct user message always first.** If this turn includes a direct user message, answer
  it before handling every other wake.
- **One wake = one turn.** Handle exactly the wake's implication, then end the turn. Never
  poll, idle-loop, or wait for another event.
- **Wakes are advisory.** Before any side effect, verify the current daemon state and the
  relevant Dispatch issue. A stale or duplicate wake may cost a read, never a wrong action.
- **Controller state is disposable.** Do not reconstruct or preserve local controller
  bookkeeping between turns.
- **Write for a human.** Every `dispatch_comment`, `dispatch_message`, and `dispatch_ask` you
  post follows `skill://dispatch`'s "Writing for the human" rules: plain sentences, every
  identifier expanded on first use, no coined shorthand. A triage note that reads like a log
  line is not a triage note.

## Wake routing table

| Wake | Content | Controller action |
|---|---|---|
| New issue created in the Dispatch project (`issue.created`, status `triage`; under the TypeScript daemon resync heals misses, under the Go daemon the boot step above does). From the Go daemon: `triage on <KEY>` (payload `{kind: "triage"}`) on the controller topic, for an unrecorded root carrying the `legion` label only ("Issues handed to Legion" above) | issue key + triage context (incl. pre-existing children) | Triage: `legion status <KEY> todo` to admit, or set `backlog`/`icebox` to park |
| Backlog eligibility (TypeScript daemon) | slot freed / priority change | Reconsider parked items and move the eligible root to `todo` |
| `slot-free on <KEY>` from the Go daemon (payload `{kind: "slot-free"}`) | the root whose slot the daemon released with no waiting root to take it | Verify a free slot in `legion state --json`, then fill it ([Keeping the slots full](#keeping-the-slots-full-go-daemon)) and post the day's report if it is due |
| Architect escalation (controller-actionable only: re-file a child as a root issue, capacity, cross-tree conflicts) | request + context | Judge and act; issue-scoped human Q&A goes through `dispatch_ask` from the owning architect, not here |
| Resync report | artifact-driven anomaly list (zero-owner trees, untriaged-open, launch-failed, admission-drift) | Verify against fresh state, then heal |
| Resync report: `admission-drift` entry | issue key + whether the daemon added it to, or removed it from, its admission list (the detail says which) | No action: the daemon already repaired it in the same run. An issue that reappears in consecutive reports is a live leak — file a LEGION issue on Dispatch with both reports pasted as evidence (never a GitHub issue) |
| `child-status` | child key + status transition | Not controller-actionable by default; if the daemon could not route it to the parent's architect role, verify the transition and forward it with `envoy_publish` |
| Mention | Slack/GitHub PR @mention text | Answer, or route to the owning issue's architect role |
| READY packet seen on a Dispatch issue (via issue subscription) | READY line + gate facts | No action: a human merges; the merger has already notified the queue role if the project has one |
| `worker-recovered` (role `architect`) from the daemon | issue, fromRef | A root architect's tree volume was lost; it restarted as a new session. Verify the tree is active in `legion state` and that the architect posts its next step on the issue within one resync interval; otherwise treat it as an anomaly. |
| `held on <KEY>` from the Go daemon (payload `{kind: "held", phase, role?, reason?}`) | the held issue, the phase it left, and the role whose claim failed, or `reason: "escalated"` | Verify the hold in `legion state` (the issue's phase is `held`). Without `reason`, a phase worker's launches or prompts ran out and the tree's architect decides retry or escalate: no action. With `reason: "escalated"` (on the record, `issues.<KEY>.holdReason` is `escalated`), the architect sent it to you: handle it as an architect escalation below. Parking the tree is `legion status <root> backlog`; setting the root back to `todo` later re-admits it as a new generation, which starts again from its architect |
| `worker-died on <KEY>` from the Go daemon with `role: "architect"` | the tree root whose architect's claim failed, and the phase the root was in | The tree's architect ran out of launches or prompts and the daemon relaunches nothing; every other notice of the tree goes to that architect, so nobody inside the tree can act. Verify in `legion state` (`issues.<KEY>.architect.state` is `failed`); if the root's phase is `done`, the tree is already parked: no action. Otherwise re-admit the tree (`legion status <root> backlog`, then `todo`: a new generation, whose architect starts again with fresh budgets) or leave it parked and say why on the issue |
| Closed-tree activity (comment, review, CI on a closed tree) | issue, root, event summary | Read the artifact; if work should resume, `legion status <root> todo`; otherwise no action — the event is not held or redelivered |
| Direct user message | — | Always first |

## New issue triage

1. Read `legion state --json`, then inspect the reported Dispatch issue with `dispatch_read`.
   Verify the issue is in this project, is eligible for a root process, and whether it
   has pre-existing children. Dispatch and daemon state, not the wake text, decide triage.
   Note the `Assignee:` line: that human answers the tree's asks, and their Inbox opens on
   the issues they hold. Never reassign during triage — who holds an issue is the humans'
   decision, made from the issue header.
2. If it should run now, admit the root issue:

   ```text
   legion status <issue> todo
   ```

3. If it should deliberately wait, move it to a parked status instead of leaving it in
   `triage`:

   ```text
   legion status <issue> backlog
   ```

   (or `icebox` for longer-term deferral). Dispatch status is the durable record; there is no
   other marker to maintain, beyond the Go daemon's `legion` label, which parking leaves in
   place. Do not triage a system-created child as a root issue.
4. When you post a triage note (a `dispatch_comment` on the issue saying what you decided and
   why), name who will be asked: `Assigned to <login>, who will get this tree's questions`,
   or, when the `Assignee:` line says `unassigned`, `Unassigned — nobody's Inbox shows this
   tree's questions until someone takes it from the issue header (Assignee, beside Priority)`.
   An unassigned root still runs; the architect's asks wait in every Inbox's Unassigned band.

## Backlog eligibility

Under the TypeScript daemon, when a slot frees or priority changes, use `legion state --json` and
the current Dispatch issue to reconsider parked roots. Admit the selected root with
`legion status <KEY> todo`. Moving an item to or from `backlog`/`icebox` is a deliberate
controller decision, not a no-op. Under the Go daemon, [Keeping the slots
full](#keeping-the-slots-full-go-daemon) is the procedure.

## Architect escalation

Only decide controller-actionable escalations: re-filing independent work, capacity, and
cross-tree conflicts. Issue-scoped human Q&A goes through `dispatch_ask` from the owning
architect, not the controller.

For an independence judgment, verify the child and its parent against current daemon state
and the Dispatch issue. If the work belongs in an independent root:

1. File a **fresh root issue** with `dispatch_issue({ project, title, spec })` (no `parent`;
   under the Go daemon add `labels: ["legion"]`, without which it is never admitted).
   `project` is the issue key's prefix before `-<n>` (e.g. `LEGSMOKE-3` → `LEGSMOKE`) — not
   the role-token `<project>` (the daemon's own project, e.g. `acme`), a different string.
2. Park the child (`legion status <child> icebox`) and leave
   a pointer to the new root issue. The controller's capability is `todo`/`backlog`/`icebox`
   only — only the owning architect or the daemon closes an issue as `done`.
3. Admit or deliberately backlog the new root through the normal triage procedure.

Never promote a child in place. Resolve capacity and cross-tree conflicts from verified
state, routing design decisions back to the owning architect when they are not controller
judgments.

## Resync report

Treat a resync report as an anomaly list, not an instruction. For every zero-owner tree,
untriaged-open, or launch-failed issue it names, verify `legion state --json` and the
current Dispatch issue first. Then heal the verified condition: admit an eligible root, move
an issue back to its intended status, or use the applicable daemon control path. Do not act
on stale entries until their source artifact explains the anomaly. An `admission-drift` entry
needs no healing — the daemon added the tree back to (or removed it from) its admission list in
the same run; verify only that the same issue does not recur in the next report, and file a
LEGION issue with both reports if it does.

## Mentions

Read the mention and its artifact. Answer it when it asks the controller for triage or
human-facing information. A human asking how to let a root proceed past its design gate
approves the root issue's spec document in Dispatch — the `Approve` control in the document's
header, or the approval question the architect's request opened in the Inbox. The controller
never opens a gate and there is no operator command for it; a project that does not want the
gate at all runs `gates.design: off` in its `legion.yaml`. Otherwise resolve the authoritative
owning architect role and route the verified context with `envoy_publish`. Do not route raw
event traffic or invent a role token from a partial issue reference.
