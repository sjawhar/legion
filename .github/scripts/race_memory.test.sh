# Tests for `race_memory.py`: a command's status passes through, a peak over the limit fails the
# step and names the tests that were running, a run within the limit ends with the peak, and a
# `go test -json` stream's output reaches the log.
#
# Each case runs the real script around a stand-in command — a shell or a Python program that
# prints a -json stream and grows — so no Go, no race binary and no database are needed. The two
# functions the sampling loop reads its numbers with, `summarize` and `choose_peak`, are called
# on their own, over fixture `/proc/<pid>/status` texts written here, because one of the rule's
# two branches cannot be reached on a kernel that reports no `VmHWM` (gVisor) and the other
# cannot be reached on one that does.
#
# Run from anywhere: .github/scripts/race_memory.test.sh
# CI runs it in ci.yaml's test job.
