# Tests for `check-ci-filters.sh`: every ci.yaml filter must match every file its job reads, the
# Go closures recomputed with go list, the table of go commands must say what ci.yaml says, and
# ci-ok's SELECTED_BY and PULL_REQUEST_ONLY must say what each needed job's if: tests.
#
# Each case builds a miniature repository under a temporary directory - a go.work binding one
# module, a ci.yaml whose `changes` job gates one job, and a ci_job_reads.py describing it - and
# symlinks the real script, its engine (ci_filter_coverage.py) and the path model it imports
# (workflow_paths.py) into it, so the code under test is the code CI runs. It needs go and a
# python3 with PyYAML.
#
# Run from anywhere: .github/scripts/check-ci-filters.test.sh
# CI runs it in ci.yaml's test job.
