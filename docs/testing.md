# Testing

Rules for this repository's tests that the code under test does not show.

## Unix sockets in Go tests

A unix socket path must be 107 bytes or shorter. Linux's `sun_path` holds 108 bytes with the
terminating zero, and Go refuses a longer path with `invalid argument` at `bind`, `listen` or
`dial`. A tmux server socket has the same limit (`Filename too long`). `t.TempDir()` puts the
test's name, cut to 64 bytes, in its path, under `GOTMPDIR` or else `TMPDIR`. With a long test name
and a socket under it, or under a directory made from it (an `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `HOME` or state
directory a test sets to `t.TempDir()`), a temporary directory of about 20 bytes is enough to pass
the limit, as on a dev box whose `TMPDIR` is on a data disk.

- Put a test's socket under a short directory of its own: `os.MkdirTemp("", "<short prefix>")`,
  removed in `t.Cleanup`. A package that binds sockets in its tests keeps one helper for it,
  `shortTempDir` (`packages/daemon/internal/daemon/daemon_test.go` is one). Use the package's
  helper, or add one where the package has none.
- Before you call a test that binds a socket done, run it with a temporary directory of about 64
  bytes. A pass under `/tmp` does not show that the test works under a longer one. Set `GOTMPDIR`
  as well, since `t.TempDir()` reads it first:

  ```sh
  L=/tmp/a-deliberately-long-tmpdir-for-unix-socket-path-tests-0001 && mkdir -p "$L"
  TMPDIR="$L" GOTMPDIR="$L" go test ./<package>/... -count=1
  ```

## Containers a test starts

Every container a test or a proof script starts carries a CPU limit and a memory limit sized to its
work, and is removed when the test stops. Tests and the live proofs run on shared dev boxes as well
as on CI runners, and an unlimited server can take every core and all the memory of a host that
other work shares.

- In Go, set `Resources.NanoCPUs` and `Resources.Memory` in the container's host configuration:
  through `testcontainers.WithHostConfigModifier` for a `Run`, or as the request's
  `HostConfigModifier` for a `GenericContainer` (`packages/envoy/internal/testpg/testpg.go` is one).
  `WithHostConfigModifier` replaces any modifier an earlier option set, so a test that needs a host
  configuration of its own sets the limits in that same modifier.
- In a script, `docker run` takes `--cpus` and `--memory` before the image. A Postgres whose data
  directory is a `tmpfs` mount counts that data against its memory limit. `scripts/e2e/README.md`
  lists each proof's containers and their limits.
- Remove a container with its anonymous volumes: `docker rm -f -v`, since the Postgres images
  declare a `VOLUME` that a plain `docker rm -f` leaves on the host.
