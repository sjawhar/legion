# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added shared schemas and descriptions for the nine native Dispatch tools.
- Added the `Agent` row type behind Dispatch's `GET /api/v1/agents`.
- Added required `Ask.opened_event_id`, the canonical event ID for an ask's opening turn.

### Removed

- Removed `HandoffMessage`, `validateHandoffMessage`, and `MESSAGES_DIR_NAME`: the `legion handoff message|messages` commands they served are gone, and nothing else read `.legion/messages/`.
