// Ledger is what the document operations joined to one database transaction produce until it
// ends: the events they generate, their writes to live documents (see liveWrite) and the versions
// they write. Join is the only way to join a transaction, so an operation that has one always has
// its ledger. Commit ends the transaction the way every caller must: it commits, credits the
// writes' authors to their rooms, releases the authors a version the transaction wrote named,
// and publishes the writes to their rooms, in that order. Discard, which callers defer right
// after Join, drops whatever a transaction that did not commit left behind.
//
// Settlement's operations run in a transaction of its own, which no caller joined, so its ledger
// carries no `tx` and marks itself `settling` instead. Those are the only two ledgers there are:
// every operation that writes a document either joins its caller's transaction or is
// settlement's own.
