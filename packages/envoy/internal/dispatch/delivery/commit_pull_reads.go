// commit_pull_reads.go bounds how often one commit's pull requests are read through
// (ReadThroughCommitPulls). It is default_branch.go's twin: that file holds how long an answer
// about a repository and a commit's place on its default branch is believed, this one how long
// an answer about the pull requests of a commit stands before GitHub is asked again. Its one
// caller is the results read (api/results_currency.go, currencyReader.readThroughHead), which
// keeps a memo for the span of one request and no policy.

// CommitPullReadStaleAfter is how long one commit's read-through stands before another read may
// run for that commit. Each read costs one GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/pulls, and
// one more per pull request GitHub names whose title, body, branch and links name nobody held to
// the repository, since that one's commit messages are paged too (attributeHead). The
// Verification tab refetches an issue's results on every result.recorded, so without a bound
// every refetch would spend those calls again for every result at a commit heading no pull
// request Dispatch knows — for ever, since nothing about such a commit is stored. Five minutes
// is the span every other answer about a commit is believed for
// (DefaultBranchCommitStaleAfter) and the one the reconcile re-reads an open head on
// (PullRequestHeadStaleAfter), so a pull request opened at a recorded commit is read as that
// result's current head within it.
const CommitPullReadStaleAfter = 5 * time.Minute

// CommitPullSettledFor is how long the answer "GitHub names a pull request for this commit whose
// head is another commit" is believed before the commit may be read through again (Settle). That
// answer is worth more than a plain read-through's and less than for ever, and the hour is the
// trade between its two costs: a commit whose pull request GitHub puts elsewhere costs one read
// an hour rather than one every CommitPullReadStaleAfter, and a pull request opened later with
// its head at that commit is seen within an hour rather than never. The second cost is the one
// an unbounded settling got wrong — a commit a push left behind is a commit a later pull request
// can open at — and an hour of `older` on such a result is one refetch's wait away from current,
// where never is a restart away.
const CommitPullSettledFor = time.Hour

// CommitPullReads is the moment before which one commit of one repository is not read through
// again, held across reads so a commit costs at most one read-through per span rather than one
// per read of the results. Its zero value is an empty cache, and the server holds one for the
// process (api.server.commitPulls), as it holds one DefaultBranches: the answer is a commit's,
// not a request's, and every goroutine reading results shares it.
//
// Only the read-time read-through records here, and the one a recorded result makes
// (api/results.go's readThroughPullRequests) must not: a result recorded while no pull request
// carries its commit would leave a fresh read behind, and the read a moment after the pull
// request opened would be refused a read-through of its own and answer `older` — which is the
// whole of what dispatch://INFRA-1240 repairs.
//
// One decision, one lock: Claim tests the moment held and records the next one together, so no
// caller can hold the two apart and two reads that ask at once cannot both be granted. One
// entry per repository-and-commit pair carries both bounds, which differ only in their span:
// Claim records CommitPullReadStaleAfter past the read it grants, and Settle CommitPullSettledFor
// past GitHub's answer that the pull request's head is elsewhere, which is the longer answer and
// the one that overwrites the claim that bought it.
//
// What bounds the map is that one span. A granted claim drops every entry whose moment has
// passed once the map has passed commitPullReadSweepAt, so nothing is kept for ever and a
// process that reads the results of many issues for weeks holds one entry per commit its last
// hour asked about. That sweep walks the whole map under the lock, and it runs only on a claim
// that is granting a GitHub call, so what waits for it is already waiting for a round trip.

// commitPullReadSweepAt is the size the map is swept from. An entry whose moment has passed
// refuses nothing and is overwritten by the next claim for its pair, so it is dead weight; below
// this size the weight is not worth a walk, and above it a process that reads the results of
// many issues for weeks would otherwise hold one entry per commit it ever asked about.

// held for the pair, or the moment held has passed — and records the next such moment,
// CommitPullReadStaleAfter past now, when it answers yes, under the one lock that read the
// bound.
//
// A read that fails is claimed with the rest: GitHub was asked, and a repository whose every ask
// fails must not be asked again on every read. One read of one issue's results asks about a
// commit once whatever this answers (api/results_currency.go, currencyReader.headOf's memo).

// the pair would be claimed again every CommitPullReadStaleAfter for as long as the result is
// read, since nothing is stored at a commit no pull request heads.
//
// It carries a moment because the answer does go stale: GitHub has answered about this commit
// for now, and a pull request opened later can have its head at it, so the answer is believed
// for a span and then asked again. The moment is recorded in the same map a claim records in,
// which is what makes the settling a longer bound of the same kind rather than a second rule:
// the sweep drops it once it has passed, as it drops every other moment no claim can be refused
