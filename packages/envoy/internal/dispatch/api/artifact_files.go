// The file store's two touchpoints on the artifact routes: an upload's object write before the
// transaction (putUploadedFile) and a version's download (serveFileVersion). storeArtifact and
// getArtifactVersion (artifacts.go) call them; the rows they read and write are theirs.

// putUploadedFile writes an upload's bytes to the file store under sha before storeArtifact opens
// its transaction, and answers the request itself when the upload is refused or the store refuses
// it. With no store, or for a document, it writes nothing. It reports whether the upload may go on.
//
// The object goes first: the bytes (up to maxArtifactBlobSize) cross the network to a store whose
// wait nothing here bounds, and the transaction takes a pooled connection and the owner's row
// lock, which every other writer of that issue queues behind. So the refusals that transaction
// makes are made first, from the pool and locking nothing (refuseUploadBeforeItsObject; an issue
// that is closed or missing is refused before the body is read, refuseUploadToAClosedIssue):
// nothing deletes an object, and one a refused upload left would be named by no row. Deleting it
// on refusal instead is not safe, since the store is keyed by the bytes' hash and another version,
// or another upload in flight, can name the same object. The transaction's own checks still
// decide: an upload this check passes that a concurrent write then makes refusable (another
// upload taking its name with another kind, the issue closing), or whose insert fails, leaves an
// object no row names, which a later upload of the same bytes reuses. The row records the hash
// the object is keyed by and no bytes.
