// WithReconnectWaitTick runs tick at each pass of the client's wait for a reconnect
// (ensureConnWithContext), before the pass blocks, and reads a connection event tick causes before
// the wait looks at its context, so a test outside the package can tell a publish is inside that
// wait, or act at the moment the wait ends. It is compiled into the package's tests only; no
// production connect can set it.
