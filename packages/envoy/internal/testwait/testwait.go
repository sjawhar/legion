// Package testwait holds the bounded wait Envoy's tests share. A test that drives real
// processes, a real database or a real socket waits for something it cannot make happen on its
// own — a delivery, the transaction that answers it — and the wait is bounded by the test
// binary's own deadline rather than a fixed span: on a loaded machine a step that is merely slow
// is not a failure, and a condition that never holds still fails, naming what it waited for.
// Eventually is the wait a test usually wants; WithinPolling takes a bound and a pace of its
// own; Holds answers rather than fails, for a caller whose failure text is its own; and Bounded
// is the clamp alone, for a wait that holds the rest itself.
