# The SPA compiles into the image (bun stage in docker/Dockerfile) — no host
# build, no bind mount. ENVOY_IMAGE_TAG is required by the compose file; a
# local build doesn't care about its value, so default it here. To run a
# published tag instead of building locally, set ENVOY_IMAGE_TAG and run
# `docker compose -f compose/dispatch.compose.yml pull && docker compose -f
# compose/dispatch.compose.yml up -d` directly.
