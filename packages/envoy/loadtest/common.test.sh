# Proves the run lock of common.sh (lock_root) without a stack. Each lock taker below sources
# common.sh and calls lock_root, as run-series.sh, run-step.sh and stack.sh do.
#
# INFRA-589 review of PR #2369: a series' run-step.sh re-opened descriptor 9, so it lost the lock
# that it inherited from run-series.sh and went on by the token alone. Killing run-series.sh then
# freed the root while its step still ran, and a new run-step.sh reset the stack under that step.
# And a refused caller could name a previous holder that had ended, whose complete record was still
# in the lock file while the new holder had locked but not yet written its own.
#
# Asserts that: (a) a holder's child that took the lock with the inherited token and descriptor
# keeps the root after the holder is killed: a third caller is refused, naming the holder's record
# and the live child, and is admitted once the child has exited; (b) a refusal names the live
# holder, not a dead previous holder whose complete record is still in the file; (c) a caller with
# the holder's token but without its descriptor 9 is refused; (d) a lock held by a process that
# this PID namespace cannot see (here: on a descriptor other than 9, under a record whose pid does
# not exist) is refused as held, naming the record's pid and the lock file not to remove, never as
# free; (e) a caller is admitted when the record's pid is dead and no process holds the lock, also
# when the holder ends while the caller waits for its record.
