# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the native Dispatch workspace API, persisted documents and events, retained Dispatch notifications, and daily Postgres backups.
- `POST /v1/roles/set` accepts `"soft": true`: the claim lands only if the role is unheld, held by a session that is no longer live, or held by the declared `previous_session_id`; any other live holder answers 409 with its id.
- Dispatch redelivers the GitHub App webhook's failed deliveries, which GitHub never redelivers on its own. Every two minutes it lists the webhook's attempts whose status is not OK and asks GitHub to redeliver each one the listener answered 5xx or GitHub could not complete. A failed or refused redelivery is retried after a doubling backoff, at most five times, and a 4xx is never redelivered. Requests go a second apart, and a GitHub rate limit stops the sweep until the time GitHub gives. `envoy-dispatch redeliver-webhooks --since <d> [--dry-run]` runs the same sweep over a chosen window.

### Fixed

- A role claim that overtook another session no longer risks deleting a newer claim made in the same instant; old-holder cleanup now touches only the previous holder's topics, never the role row.
- Document version mutations now emit one retained, non-notifying `comment.anchor_refreshed` or `ask.anchor_refreshed` event for each changed open anchor, so stream consumers immediately observe orphaned quotes.
- A webhook redelivery of an event the notification stream already holds no longer publishes a second copy. Webhook envelopes whose dedupe key is the source plus the upstream delivery id (GitHub's `X-GitHub-Delivery`, Slack's `event_id`, Ghost Wispr's `X-GhostWispr-Delivery`) now publish under a JetStream MsgId of that key and topic, the rule Dispatch envelopes already used. Other producers that publish under those source names - CI settlements, the MCP bridge and `/v1/messages/*` callers - still publish every time. GitHub documents that a redelivery carries the original `X-GitHub-Delivery`, and Slack retries under the original `event_id`; that Ghost Wispr resends under its original delivery id is assumed, not documented.
