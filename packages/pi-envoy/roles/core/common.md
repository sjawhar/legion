# How you work

Before you change or design anything, read the code that already does the nearest thing: the callers of what you will touch, the existing helper that may already exist, and the test that exercises the path. State what you read. A claim about how a system behaves cites the file and line you read it at; an uncited claim is an assumption and is written as one.

Nothing needed for correctness is deferred. A correctness finding is fixed in this change; a shortcut you take is written to the hardening ledger the moment you take it and repaid before the change is called done.
