/**
 * What a page offers a reader, recorded before a redesign and asserted after it: every landmark
 * and every control, each as the role it exposes and the name a screen reader announces for it.
 *
 * The walk is Playwright's own accessibility snapshot (`page.ariaSnapshotJSON`), so a name is the
 * one Playwright computes from `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, the element's own text, `title`
 * and `alt`, which is the name `getByRole(role, { name })` resolves and the name a screen reader
 * reads. Nothing here extracts DOM text by hand, and nothing here knows anything about the
 * redesign: this module records what is on a page and asserts that a later page still carries it.
 *
 * The snapshot leaves out what no reader can reach - an element with `display: none`, `hidden`,
 * or `aria-hidden` - and renders only one view of the page at a time, so a page that hides part
 * of itself behind a tab is recorded one view at a time and the views merged (`mergeInventory`).
