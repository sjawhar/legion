// The tree lifecycle (internal/treelifecycle) is the store's barrier between a tree's runnable
// work and its cleanup, under every runtime. A claim is bound to its tree's open epoch when it is
// admitted (Store.AdmitClaim) and every launch rechecks that binding (Store.CheckLaunch) before it
// persists StateLaunching or calls the runtime. A reserved cleanup answers either with
// treelifecycle.ErrCleanupReserved, a wait that changes nothing and charges no budget; the start
// that met it retries once the cleanup confirmed and a fresh admission opened the next epoch.

// revive binds an explicitly spawned, resumed or retried claim to the open tree epoch before
// launching. In-lifetime recovery only rechecks the bound epoch (checkLaunch), so an old launch
// cannot cross a cleanup confirmation into a later admission.

// checkLaunch is the lifecycle recheck every launch makes first: a claim whose tree cleanup is
// reserved, or whose bound epoch is no longer the open one, starts nothing and changes nothing, so
// a relaunch refused here charges no budget.
