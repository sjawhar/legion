/**
 * A Dispatch refusal carrying its own code in the message the host shows: the code
 * (ISSUE_CLAIMED, CLAIM_CONTENDED, EXTERNAL_LINK_TAKEN, ...) is the part an agent acts on, and
 * the prose alone hides it. Only the message changes: every other field of the refusal
 * (`candidates`, `current`, `mismatches`) rides along, since a caller reads them off the error
 * it catches. An error that is not a refusal is returned as it is, so a caller's
 * `throw refusalWithCode(error)` rethrows it untouched. This returns rather than throws, so the
 * throw stays at the call site, where a reader of the handler sees that the path ends there.
 *
 * A gateway's answer stays a `DispatchGatewayError`, and the caller's account of what its call did
 * joins it in one sentence. Where the request may have reached Dispatch (`mayHaveReachedDispatch`),
 * the client's advice could judge only from the method (a write is told to check whether it took
 * effect), so that account, which knows what its call did, takes its place and must say what to do;
 * otherwise the request never reached Dispatch, and the account follows the client's advice.
