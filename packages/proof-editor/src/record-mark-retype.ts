/**
 * Retyping a provisional record mark: the margin composer's Comment / Suggest / Ask switch.
 *
 * The selection bar (./dispatch-action-bar.ts `runAction`) writes a mark of the pressed kind and
 * the server verifies that a record's `mark_id` names a mark of the record's own kind
 * (`docs.VerifyMark`). When the reader switches the composer's kind, the mark has to follow:
 * `retypeMark` writes a fresh mark of the new kind over the same text with the three creators
 * the bar uses - which mint the new mark's id, so the id changes with the kind, as the server's
 * bookkeeping expects (it keys a mark by type and id) - then removes the old one.
 *
 * Neither the new mark nor the removal is an undo step: ./record-mark-history.ts keeps the
 * composer's own record-mark writes out of undo history, so Ctrl/Cmd+Z after a switch never puts
 * the old mark back and redo never writes it again. The creation takes nothing from another
 * record: the three record marks declare `excludes: ''`, so a mark of the new kind over text that
 * another record's mark of that kind covers sits beside that mark rather than cutting it
 * (LEGION-458).
 *
 * `removeRecordMark` is the precise removal both this module and the handle's `removeMark` use:
 * span by span, by id, whatever the mark's type. Upstream's `deleteMark` is not it - it cannot
 * see a provisional comment (`buildAnchorMarks` drops a comment anchor whose body is empty, and
 * the bar creates comments with an empty body) - and nothing else is needed: once the spans are
 * gone, the marks plugin's own `normalizeMetadata` drops the metadata of every id no longer
 * anchored.
