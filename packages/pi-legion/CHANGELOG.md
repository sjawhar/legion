# Changelog

`@sjawhar/pi-legion` was split from `@sjawhar/pi-legion-envoy` 7.x (LEGION-247). Every release
before the split, and the Envoy plugin's releases after it, are in `packages/pi-envoy/CHANGELOG.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A controller the Go daemon launches itself (`controller: daemon` in `legion.yaml`, LEGION-592)
  runs as a controller session: a session with `LEGION_CONTROLLER=1` and `LEGION_BOOT_TOKEN_FILE`
  registers on `/legion/v1/claims/register` with that boot token in place of a controller
  capability, claims `legion-<project>-controller`, subscribes to the controller topic, and then
  calls `/legion/v1/claims/ready`, when the daemon sends its start message. A claim step that fails
  exits Oh My Pi, so the daemon relaunches it. The operator-launched controller is unchanged.

### Changed

- The `legion-worker` skill says what a shell `legion handoff complete` and a `task` subagent's bash
  can do since LEGION-630 removed the role gate, and how the phase-stall reminder then behaves
  (LEGION-634): a shell completion completes the phase at the daemon and nothing refuses it, but
  only the `legion` tool's `handoff_complete` closes the extension's phase stall, so the reminder
  recurs at each settle after an Envoy delivery until a tool `handoff_complete` succeeds, and a
  completion made on it is refused (`HANDOFF_NOT_CURRENT_PHASE` or `HANDOFF_ALREADY_RECORDED`); a
  subagent has every tool but the `legion` tool, mints no grant, and runs `legion` commands on its
  parent's last grant within its 60 seconds. `legion.daemonApiVersion` is unchanged.
- No Legion handoff reaches the default branch (LEGION-605). The `legion-retro` skill ends retro
  with one final commit that removes the issue's `.legion/<issue>/`, pushed with its
  `docs/solutions/` commit in one `legion push`; the `legion-worker` and `legion-architect` skills
  and the merge-gate reference say the merger accepts that commit above the approved head and that
  READY refuses a head still carrying it, in place of the rule that every head kept `.legion/` and
  the daemon stripped main's from the next branch. The `legion` tool's `handoff_read` description
  says it finds a handoff that commit removed. Install this release with a Go `legion` built from
  the same commit, whose `legion handoff read` reads such a handoff and whose READY makes that
  refusal. `legion.daemonApiVersion` is unchanged.
- `legion.daemonApiVersion` is 16 (LEGION-578). Contract 16 adds `capabilities` to
  `GET /legion/v1/state`: the deployment's capability report, one row per capability with its
  `status` (`present`, `installed`, `unchecked`, `live`, `withheld`, `decided` or `open`), its
  `detail`, and on an open row the `configLine` to write into `legion.yaml`. Install this release
  with a Go `legion` built from the same commit; the daemon's image probe refuses a worker image
  whose plugin declares 15 (the 8.3.0 release, whose strict state reader has no `capabilities`).
- `legion.daemonApiVersion` is 15. Contract 15 changes a Sandbox locator on the daemon's
  `GET /legion/v1/state`: every role of an issue now runs in one shared Agent Sandbox pod, so the
  `sandbox` member names the issue's Sandbox, the pod's uid, the role container and the process
  generation, and the incarnation is `<pod uid>/<generation>` (LEGION-462). The client's strict
  state parse needs a daemon at this release's contract (the `legion.daemonApiVersion` entry
  above); the daemon's boot gate refuses any earlier contract.
- Every phase worker stays live from its role's first assignment until its issue closes
  (LEGION-462): no move between phases suspends it, so a role that finished its phase still
  answers questions through Envoy, and its next assignment arrives in the same session. The worker
  and architect skills and the headless worker prompt say so, in place of the phase-end suspension
  LEGION-223's entry in `packages/pi-envoy/CHANGELOG.md` describes.
- `legion.daemonApiVersion` is 14 (LEGION-592). Contract 14 adds the daemon-launched controller's
  pod, whose agent's environment carries `LEGION_CONTROLLER=1` beside `LEGION_BOOT_TOKEN_FILE`: this
  release registers it with the launch's boot token, where an earlier one reads it as the
  operator's controller and never registers. Install this release with a Go `legion` built from
  the same commit; the daemon's image probe refuses a worker image whose plugin declares 13.
- **Breaking:** the Legion plugin is its own package, `@sjawhar/pi-legion`, split from
  `@sjawhar/pi-legion-envoy` 7.x (LEGION-247). It carries `extensions/legion.ts` (published as
  `dist/legion.js`), the Legion lifecycle modules (`src/`, the former `src/legion/`), the task agents
  in `agents/`, the eight Legion skills (`legion-architect`, `legion-controller`, `legion-oracle`,
  `legion-retro`, `legion-worker`, `ce-simplify-code`, `thermonuclear-code-quality`,
  `thermonuclear-deep-review`) at `dist/skills`, and `legion.daemonApiVersion`, which the split
  itself did not move (no request, response or pane variable changed): the pre-split package's last
  release left it at 13 (LEGION-583: the `push` grant for `legion push` and the worker image's
  `LEGION_REMOVABLE_WORKSPACES` payload, described in `packages/pi-envoy/CHANGELOG.md`), and this
  release declares 16 (LEGION-578, above; 15 since LEGION-462, 14 since LEGION-592). The Envoy messaging and Dispatch tools every session loads are
  `@sjawhar/pi-envoy`'s, installed beside this package; a Legion pane needs both.
  The Legion entry claims roles, matches injected user turns and reads the bootstrapped session
  through the in-process interface the Envoy entry publishes (`@legion/pi-shared/interface`, version
  1), and in a Legion session refuses to run, naming the remedy, when no `@sjawhar/pi-envoy` is
  loaded, when the loaded one speaks another interface version, or when `@sjawhar/pi-legion-envoy`
  is still installed beside it (`omp plugin uninstall @sjawhar/pi-legion-envoy`). The daemon's boot
  gate, `legion probe-image` and `legion controller start` refuse the same three by name. Links from
  a Legion skill into the `dispatch` skill are `skill://dispatch/...`, which resolve once both plugins
  are installed. Install both into the daemon's Oh My Pi profile:
  `omp plugin install @sjawhar/pi-envoy && omp plugin install @sjawhar/pi-legion`.

### Removed

- The extension's role gate — the architect's bash restriction to a single `legion` command, and
  the architect's, reviewer's and merger's refusal of `edit`, `write` and `apply_patch` — and the
  shell refusal of `legion handoff complete` are removed (LEGION-630). No role is refused a tool:
  the role prompts alone say who edits what, and the operation-log rule (`jj undo`, `jj abandon`,
  `jj op restore|revert|abandon|undo` refused in every tree pane and its `task` subagents) stays.
  `legion.daemonApiVersion` is unchanged.
