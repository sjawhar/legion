# Changelog

`@sjawhar/pi-legion` was split from `@sjawhar/pi-legion-envoy` 7.x (LEGION-247). Every release
before the split, and the Envoy plugin's releases after it, are in `packages/pi-envoy/CHANGELOG.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A controller the Go daemon launches itself (`controller: daemon` in `legion.yaml`, LEGION-592)
  runs as a controller session: a session with `LEGION_CONTROLLER=1` and `LEGION_BOOT_TOKEN_FILE`
  registers on `/legion/v1/claims/register` with that boot token in place of a controller
  capability, claims `legion-<project>-controller`, subscribes to the controller topic, and then
  calls `/legion/v1/claims/ready`, when the daemon sends its start message. A claim step that fails
  exits Oh My Pi, so the daemon relaunches it. The operator-launched controller is unchanged.

### Changed

- An architect's one shell command is held to one scan whatever its head: a `legion` command now
  refuses `$()`, backticks, redirects and comments as a `dispatch` command does, where it refused
  only `;`, `&`, `|` and a newline (found in LEGION-588's review). A here-document ends only where
  bash ends it: at a line that is exactly its delimiter, with leading tabs stripped under `<<-`
  alone and no line's trailing blanks dropped, and the scan splits words on space and tab only,
  never a no-break space, byte-order mark or ideographic space, which bash reads as part of a word.
  A test holds the scan to a real bash over 2,822 generated commands.
- `legion.daemonApiVersion` is 16 (LEGION-588). Contract 16 moves the daemon's role prompts from
  native Dispatch tools to the `dispatch` command bundled by `@sjawhar/pi-envoy`; pair this
  release with a Go `legion` built from the same commit, so an agent is never instructed to use a
  surface its installed plugin does not provide.
- `legion.daemonApiVersion` is 15. Contract 15 changes a Sandbox locator on the daemon's
  `GET /legion/v1/state`: every role of an issue now runs in one shared Agent Sandbox pod, so the
  `sandbox` member names the issue's Sandbox, the pod's uid, the role container and the process
  generation, and the incarnation is `<pod uid>/<generation>` (LEGION-462). The client's strict
  state parse needs this release beside a daemon at 15; the daemon's boot gate refuses any earlier
  contract.
- Every phase worker stays live from its role's first assignment until its issue closes
  (LEGION-462): no move between phases suspends it, so a role that finished its phase still
  answers questions through Envoy, and its next assignment arrives in the same session. The worker
  and architect skills and the headless worker prompt say so, in place of the phase-end suspension
  LEGION-223's entry in `packages/pi-envoy/CHANGELOG.md` describes.
- `legion.daemonApiVersion` is 14 (LEGION-592). Contract 14 adds the daemon-launched controller's
  pod, whose agent's environment carries `LEGION_CONTROLLER=1` beside `LEGION_BOOT_TOKEN_FILE`: this
  release registers it with the launch's boot token, where an earlier one reads it as the
  operator's controller and never registers. Install this release with a Go `legion` built from
  the same commit; the daemon's image probe refuses a worker image whose plugin declares 13.
- **Breaking:** the Legion plugin is its own package, `@sjawhar/pi-legion`, split from
  `@sjawhar/pi-legion-envoy` 7.x (LEGION-247). It carries `extensions/legion.ts` (published as
  `dist/legion.js`), the Legion lifecycle modules (`src/`, the former `src/legion/`), the task agents
  in `agents/`, the eight Legion skills (`legion-architect`, `legion-controller`, `legion-oracle`,
  `legion-retro`, `legion-worker`, `ce-simplify-code`, `thermonuclear-code-quality`,
  `thermonuclear-deep-review`) at `dist/skills`, and `legion.daemonApiVersion`, which the split
  itself did not move (no request, response or pane variable changed): the pre-split package's last
  release left it at 13 (LEGION-583: the `push` grant for `legion push` and the worker image's
  `LEGION_REMOVABLE_WORKSPACES` payload, described in `packages/pi-envoy/CHANGELOG.md`), and this
  release declares 16 (LEGION-588, above) after main's 15 (LEGION-462) and 14 (LEGION-592). The
  Envoy messaging and Dispatch command every session uses are `@sjawhar/pi-envoy`'s, installed
  beside this package; a Legion pane needs both.
  The Legion entry claims roles, matches injected user turns and reads the bootstrapped session
  through the in-process interface the Envoy entry publishes (`@legion/pi-shared/interface`, version
  1), and in a Legion session refuses to run, naming the remedy, when no `@sjawhar/pi-envoy` is
  loaded, when the loaded one speaks another interface version, or when `@sjawhar/pi-legion-envoy`
  is still installed beside it (`omp plugin uninstall @sjawhar/pi-legion-envoy`). The daemon's boot
  gate, `legion probe-image` and `legion controller start` refuse the same three by name. Links from
  a Legion skill into the `dispatch` skill are `skill://dispatch/...`, which resolve once both plugins
  are installed. Install both into the daemon's Oh My Pi profile:
  `omp plugin install @sjawhar/pi-envoy && omp plugin install @sjawhar/pi-legion`.
