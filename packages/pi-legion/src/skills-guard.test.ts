// root: the staged skills themselves and the daemon's prompts (its role prompts in roles/ and its
// overlays in go/). A `skill://` link resolves by name through Oh My Pi's discovery, so it is held to
// the repository's skills/, where both plugins' skills live: `skill://dispatch/…` from this
// partition is valid because the Envoy plugin, installed beside this one, ships it.
